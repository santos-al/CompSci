# Week 1

## Video 1 - Intro

### What do computers really do?

They really only do two things...

1. Perform calculations (they can do about a billion calculations a second)
2. Remember things 

Every computer comes with a set of calculations that it can do. Mainly just primitive arithmetic operations.

### Limitations

1. Encryptions on computer rely on computing limitations
2. Turing Halting Problem - states that if you want to write program, that could take as input, any other program and return whether it will always work... You can't always compute that

## Video 2 - Knowledge  

### Types of Knowledge

declarative knowledge - is a statement of fact

imperative knowledge - is a recipe or "how-to"

## Video 3 - Machines

- fixed program computer (e.g. handheld calculators, they were meant to just do arithmetic calculations not search the web)

- stored program computer - you can load recipes onto it, you can load a variety of programs. Effectively it loads in a fixed program computer for each new program I load in.


### Basic Machine Architecture

- Memory (e.g. I/O, Data, a sequence of instructions)
- The heart of the machine
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - takes info from memory, reads it in, do a primitive operation, and stores it back into memory
  - Control Unit - keeps track of what specific operation you want to do in the ALU at a point in time.
    - Program counter - keeps track of where you are in your program. It will read the first instruction. Once that is complete it will add one to the counter and proceed to the next instruction in the program.

### Basic Primitives (Turing Complete)

Turing showed you can compute anything with just 6 primitives (move left, move right, scan, read, write, do nothing)

Computational Thinking allows us to create our own primitives so that we can begin to abstract away from Turing's 6 primitives

Anything that is computable in one programming language is computable in any other. Languages make performing specific task easier. (e.g. C is easy for web programming, Matlab is good at manipulating matrices)


## Video 4 - Languages

### Creating Recipes

a programming language provides a set of primitive **operations**.

**expressions** are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language

expressions and computations have **values** and meanings in a programming language

### Aspects of Languages

Every programming language can be thought of a consisting of a set of...

1. primitives
2. a means of combinations
3. a means of abstraction (taking some complex expression and treating it as it's a primitive)

Primitive constructs in a programming language

- numbers
- strings
- simple operations


## Video 5 - Types

A **program** is a sequence of definitions and commands 

**Commands** instruct and interpreter to do something 

Programs manipulate **data objects**

Scalar Objects (cannot be subdivided)
 - int
 - float
 - bool
 - NoneType

Non-Scalar (have internal structures that can be accessed)


## Video 6 - Variables

The equal sign is used for assignment of a variable


## Video 7 - Operators and Branching
