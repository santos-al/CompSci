"""
Suppose that you’re in a country where it’s customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, 
lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. Wouldn’t it be nice if you
 had a program that could tell you what to eat when?

In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, 
lunch time, or dinner time. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s 
input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance,
 whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, 
a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" 
(i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

    time = input("Please input a time. ").strip()
    answer = convert(time)
    
    if (7.0 <= answer <= 8.0):
        print("breakfast time")
    elif (12.0 <= answer <= 13.0):
        print("lunch time")
    elif (18.0 <= answer <= 19.0):
        print("dinner time")

def convert(time):
    hours, minutes = time.split(":")
    answer = int(hours) + (int(minutes) / 60)
    return answer
