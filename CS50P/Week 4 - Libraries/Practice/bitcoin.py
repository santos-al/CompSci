"""
Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. 
Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, 
otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, 
as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, 
, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, 
the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, 
which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of 
 Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

import requests
import sys

try:
    amount = sys.argv[1]
    response = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json")
    json_response = response.json()
    price = round(json_response["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"] * float(amount), 4)
    print(f"${price:,}")
except requests.RequestException:
    sys.exit("Missing command-line argument")
except:
    sys.exit("Command-line argument is not a number")
